<h2 id="what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function">What even is a &ldquo;Highly Compressed Emoji Shortcode Lookup Function&rdquo;?<a href="#what-even-is-a-highly-compressed-emoji-shortcode-lookup-function" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Before embarking on our quest, we should probably clarify what it is we&rsquo;re
looking for exactly exactly.</p>
<p>We want to write a function that accepts shortcode strings as input, and outputs
UTF-8 emoji as output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#75715e">// e.g: shortcode_to_emoji(&#34;flamingo&#34;) -&gt; Some(&#34;🦩&#34;)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">fn</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">shortcode_to_emoji</span>(input: <span style="color:#66d9ef">&amp;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">str</span>) -&gt; Option<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;&amp;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">str</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>At first glance, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to difficult: just find a free, open source
dataset of emoji shortcodes, load that data into memory, construct a hashmap,
and start querying it - easy peasy!</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>While that approach would work just fine on your fancy shmancy
Linux/Windows/macOS/TempleOS powered desktop computer, what if we wanted to run
this lookup function on something a little bit more&hellip; embedded? If we tried to
dynamically construct a hashmap at runtime on a tiny, resource-constrained
ARM/AVR microcontroller, we&rsquo;d very quickly run out of dynamic memory (assuming
something like <code>malloc</code> is even <em>available</em> on said platform)!</p>
<p>Indeed, therein lies the need for a &ldquo;Highly Compressed&rdquo; lookup function - if we
want to run this code on an embedded MCU, the lookup function lookup function
will have to occupy as little static storage (code <em>and</em> read-only data) as
possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking to yourself &ldquo;who in their right mind
would want to map emoji shortcodes on embedded hardware?&rdquo; Fair enough! I&rsquo;ve
included my inspiration behind this wild endeavor in the next section.</p>
<p>Then again, if you&rsquo;re mostly interested in the problem itself, feel free to
skip ahead to <a href="#-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-">Getting a feel for the Data</a>.</p>

<h2 id="-inspiration-">💡 Inspiration 💡<a href="#-inspiration-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">custom mechanical keyboards</a>, as
aside from looking and sounding awesome, they&rsquo;re also an excellent
hardware-hacking platform. Most custom mechanical keyboards use the open source
<a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK firmware</a>, which comes with a host of
built-in features for doing just about anything you&rsquo;d want on a keyboard.</p>
<p>One particularly useful QMK feature is its ability to
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode">type Unicode characters</a>.
In a nutshell, you can program your keyboard such that when a certain key (or
sequence of keys) is pressed, it will send whatever keystrokes are required to
input Unicode on any of the several
<a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode#2-input-modes-id-input-modes">supported platforms</a>.
This is great, because it means that the 🅱 emoji is never more than a few
keystrokes away!</p>
<p>One somewhat annoying limitation of QMK&rsquo;s built-in Unicode support is that users
are required to define which emoji they&rsquo;d like to use <em>ahead of time</em>. While
it&rsquo;s not too difficult to find a set of &ldquo;workhorse&rdquo; emoji to preload onto the
keyboard, it&rsquo;d certainly be convenient to also be able to type more &ldquo;bespoke&rdquo;
emoji when the need arises. Sure, quick and easy access to the 🅱 emoji is great
and all, but what about those rare cases where I quickly need access to the 🦩
emoji? What am I supposed to do - use my OS&rsquo;s built-in emoji picker like a
<em>peasant??</em> Never!</p>
<p>And so, I decided to spend my valuable free time on something some folks might
call &ldquo;a total waste of time&rdquo;: writing a Rust library that exports a single
function that can look up emoji shortcodes using the minimum amount of code +
read-only data, and without requiring <em>any</em> heap allocation!</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, let&rsquo;s dive into the implementation!</p>
<h2 id="-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-">📝 Getting a feel for the Data 📝<a href="#-getting-a-feel-for-the-data-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>First things first, we&rsquo;ll need a dataset of emoji shortcodes to work with. For
this project, I decided to use the same emoji database as used by GitHub, since
it&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m most familiar with, and it&rsquo;s also readily available as a big
&lsquo;ol
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gemoji/master/db/emoji.json">JSON blob</a>.
The particular dataset exhibits the following properties:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>total shortcode, emoji pairs</td>
<td>1848</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>raw emoji UTF-8 character data</td>
<td>11096 bytes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>raw shortcode character data</td>
<td>18715 bytes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>average shortcode length</td>
<td>10.12716 bytes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>average emoji length</td>
<td>6.004329 bytes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Converting this data set into a CSV file of raw <code>shortcode,emoji</code> pairs would
result in roughly <strong>~34kb</strong> file. Aside from being a totally impractical data
structure for querying on a embedded MCU, 34kb is quite a bit of data in an
embedded context! Let&rsquo;s see if we can do any better&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="-implementation-">🛠️ Implementation 🛠️<a href="#-implementation-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The foundation of my lookup function is a heavily modified version of the
incredible <a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf">rust-phf</a> crate to generate a
set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">perfect hash maps</a>
mapping shortcodes to emoji at compile time.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we weren&rsquo;t looking for a &ldquo;highly&rdquo; compressed mapping, and were find
with one that was simply allocation-free, then we could have simply used the
unmodified <code>rust-phf</code> crate, which would result in <strong>~100kb</strong> of code + data
overhead. Unfortunately, 100kb blows waaaaay past the flash ROM budget of the
embedded hardware we are targeting, so we need to get a bit more clever&hellip;</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: By employing a whole host of optimizations and data
layout/representation tricks, I was able to crunch that 100kb down to a measly
<strong>~20kb of <code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code></strong>!</p>
<h3 id="trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-keys-themselves">Trick 1 - Storing hashes of 🔑 keys 🔑 (instead of keys themselves)<a href="#trick-1---storing-hashes-of--keys--instead-of-keys-themselves" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Instead of naively storing the keys as raw strings (which would take up a <em>lot</em>
of space, around <code>size_of(char*) + 10</code> bytes on average), the hash map only
stores the <em>hashes</em> of keys.</p>
<p>While this trick can result in some absolutely <em>monstrous</em> space savings, it
does so at the expense of a property most folks take for granted when using a
hash-map: 100% accuracy in rejecting invalid inputs. Indeed, using this
approach, the lookup function will actually have an infinite number of &ldquo;false
positive&rdquo; inputs that return nonsense outputs.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no statistician, so I really can&rsquo;t comment to the theoretical accuracy
of this approach, but empirical testing using some automated stress-testing +
human trials (i.e: slamming the keys on my keyboard) seems to suggest that a <strong>2
byte hash works almost perfectly</strong>. Heck, if you&rsquo;re really worried about space,
<strong>even single byte hashes works great!</strong></p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t just take my word for it - check out the
<a href="https://prilik.com/compressed-emoji-shortcodes">online demo</a> and play around
with the lookup function directly. It&rsquo;s should be pretty difficult to find any
&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; false positive inputs (i.e: one that&rsquo;s only a misspelling or two
away from a valid input).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Side Note:</em> Why does a <em>perfect</em> hash function even need to store the keys in
the first place?</strong></p>
<p>i.e: won&rsquo;t every input just automagically mapped to the correct value?</p>
<p>Well, while that may be true for <em>valid</em> inputs, plugging an <em>invalid</em> input
into a PHF will simply return some arbitrary index. To reject invalid inputs,
most perfect hash maps will include an
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/blob/9b70bd9/phf/src/map.rs#L88">additional check</a>
that compares the input key against the expected key at that particular index.
This ensure that invalid inputs are rejected with 100% certainty.</p>
<p>If this extra check wasn&rsquo;t in place, just imagine what sort of chaos simple
input errors might result in! A harmless spelling mistake while typing
<code>😄</code>, compounded with some spectacularly bad statistical chance, could
somehow result in typing <code>🍆</code> instead. One second you&rsquo;re having a
friendly chat with a co-worker, when all of a sudden *WHABAM* you&rsquo;re in a
meeting with HR frantically trying to explain how perfect hash functions work.
Yikes 🍆</p>

<h3 id="trick-2---storing-emoji-without-the-overhead-of-offsets-or--pointers-">Trick 2 - Storing emoji without the overhead of offsets or 👉 pointers 👈<a href="#trick-2---storing-emoji-without-the-overhead-of-offsets-or--pointers-" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The typical way to store static strings within a map is to store <em>pointers</em> to
the strings, and storing the strings themselves somewhere else in read-only
memory. Unfortunately, in this particular situation, this naive way of storing
strings results in some substantial overhead, as aside from storing the raw
UTF-8 string data for each emoji, we also need to store a pointer to the
string + some way to mark the bounds of a string (either by storing the string&rsquo;s
length, or by including a null terminator). Given that most emoji are only ~6
bytes long, a <code>size_of(char*) + 1</code> overhead per entry is <em>brutal</em>.</p>
<p>In memory, this naive table layout would look something like this:</p>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="A single table storing strings of any length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/naive_table.png"/>
  <br>
  <i>Total overhead:<br><code>size_of(Table) + (Table.Emoji.len * (1 + size_of(char*))) + (raw emoji UTF8)</code></i>
  <br>
  <i>(Assuming string length is stored alongside the pointer)</i>
</p>
<p>Can we do any better? Absolutely!</p>
<p>Instead of generating a single map containing all the shortcode-emoji mappings,
<code>n</code> distinct maps are generated instead, one for each unique emoji string size.
With this setup, string data can be accessed directly, without requiring any
additional pointer indirection.</p>
<p>In memory, this smarter table layout would look something like this:</p>
<p align="center">
  <img alt="Multiple tables storing strings of uniform length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/smarter_table.png"/>
  <br>
  <i>Total overhead:<br><code>2 * size_of(Table) + (raw emoji UTF8)</code></i>
</p>
<p>Look at that! We totally cut out the <code>Table.Emoji.len * (1 + size_of(char*))</code>
overhead!</p>
<p>Of course, this optimization did require allocating a whole new table, which
does incur an additional <code>size_of(Table)</code> bytes of overhead, but if the table
contains a large number of values, then this extra overhead is negligible with
respect to the space saved by removing the pointer indirection.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Now that there are multiple tables, the lookup function needs to be
modified to iterate through <em>all</em> the tables, returning when a result is found.
This is an easy fix to implement, though it can result in some problems down the
line&hellip;</p>

<p><em>Content Warning: *Spicy* 2D Dynamic Programming Algorithms Ahead</em></p>
<p>Before covering the last major trick, I should mention an interesting
optimization opportunity related to generating multiple tables:</p>
<p>For our particular emoji shortcode dataset, the following tables gets generated:</p>

    margin: auto;

</div>
<p>As it turns out, there are plenty of awkwardly-sized emoji in this data set.
While most emoji tend to be in the 3-8 byte range, some emoji take up
substantially more space. For example, the flag of Wales emoji (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿) takes up a
whopping 28 bytes!</p>
<p>This is quite unfortunate, as it requires generating whole new tables just for
these occasional odd-sized emoji. This is undesirable for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each table has an overhead associated with it, namely, the <code>size_of</code> the
<code>phf::Map</code> structure + the various bits of data it maintains internal
pointers. For certain smaller tables, this overhead can be greater than the
size of the data stored within the table itself!</li>
<li>The more tables there are, the more likely a hash-collision occurs while
looking up entries deeper into the list. This will be covered in more detail
in the Trick 3 section later on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suffice it to say, it&rsquo;d be nice if we could somehow consolidate tables with
fewer entries into their nearest-neighbors, thereby saving ourselves from
requiring all these additional tables. As it turns out, it&rsquo;s not actually that
difficult to consolidate two tables into one - all it takes is a bit of
null-padding!</p>
<p>Say we have a table that stores strings of length 3, containing
<code>[&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;]</code>, and another table that stores strings of length 4,
containing just <code>[&quot;four&quot;]</code>. We can merge these two tables together by adding
some null-padding to each element in the first table, and then merging the two
tables together. The final result is a <em>single</em> table that stores strings of
length 4, containing <code>[&quot;foo\0&quot;, &quot;bar\0&quot;, &quot;baz\0&quot;, &quot;four&quot;]</code>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, finding the <em>optimal</em> order in which to merge tables is
actually surprisingly tricky, and presents the opportunity for some interesting
algorithm crafting. In fact, we can re-write this problem more abstractly as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a set of tables <code>T1..Tn</code>, where each table stores <code>m</code> strings of
length <code>n</code>.</p>
<p>Each table has a fixed overhead of <code>K</code> bytes associated with it.</p>
<p>Given two tables <code>Ta</code> and <code>Tb</code> with <code>ma</code> and <code>mb</code> entries respectively, is it
possible to <em>consolidate</em> the two tables into a single table by padding the
strings contained within the <code>T_min(a, b)</code> table with <code>max(a, b) - min(a, b)</code>
&ldquo;padding&rdquo; bytes, and then merging the two tables into a single <code>T_max(a, b)</code>
table with <code>ma + mb</code> entries.</p>
<p>Q1. Find an algorithm that consolidates the tables that minimizes the total
space used.</p>
<p>Q2. Find an algorithm that consolidates the maximum number of tables without
introducing any additional space overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two questions optimize for the two different shortcomings listed above:
space saving, and hash-collisions. Which of the two algorithms to use depends on
the data set and what sort of properties you want the lookup function to have.</p>
<p>Now, truth be told, the algorithm that&rsquo;s currently implemented in the library on
GitHub is <em>absolutely horrendous</em>. I wrote it <em>very</em> late at night, and I&rsquo;ve
been too lazy to delete it + rewrite it ever since.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I happen to be friends with someone who&rsquo;s pretty darn good at these
sorts of algorithm questions, and managed to <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd snipe</a>
my friend <a href="https://github.com/ethan-hardy">Ethan Hardy</a> into finding a really
elegant and interesting solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m more of a &ldquo;maker&rdquo;-type software engineer rather than a &ldquo;computer
scientist&rdquo;-type software engineer, I asked Ethan to describe the algorithm in
his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To full optimize our space usage with these tables, we can employ the use of
some dynamic programming techniques.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we can iterate through a DP table storing solutions to
subproblems restricted over two dimensions: which tables we have available,
and which table must be the lowest-string-length unmerged table (unmerged here
meaning not itself merged into another table; having tables with smaller
strings merged into the table is ok).</p>
<p>Why this solution works is somewhat non-obvious, and the rationale behind the
unmerged restriction is also fairly hard to describe&hellip; succinctly. All of
this is to say that I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and written a full, LaTeX typeset &ldquo;white
paper&rdquo; that dives into the details of the algorithm.</p>

<p>I <em>really</em> recommend checking out Ethan&rsquo;s writeup - it&rsquo;s really cool seeing how
dynamic programming can be used to solve a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; problem, as opposed to
just contrived leetcode-style questions.</p>
<h3 id="trick-3---eliminate-invalid-mappings-using--randomness--and-fixup-tables">Trick 3 - Eliminate invalid mappings using 🎲 randomness 🎲 and fixup tables<a href="#trick-3---eliminate-invalid-mappings-using--randomness--and-fixup-tables" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a critical issue associated with using Trick #2 - using
multiple maps may result in incorrect mappings for <em>valid</em> inputs. In the
single-map approach, the properties of the PHF ensure that each valid input is
mapped to a unique index, while in the multi-map approach, this property no
longer holds, as valid inputs are also checked against hashmaps they <em>aren&rsquo;t</em>
in, opening the door for hash-collisions.</p>
<p>This is totally unacceptable, and has to be accounted for!</p>
<p>The approach I took was inspired by a bit of tech folklore from Naughty Dog
studios: while working on the original Crash Bandicoot, the developers were
having trouble fitting game assets into the PS1&rsquo;s very limited memory. The
solution they came up with? Writing a custom packer tool that randomly tests
various packing arrangements until one that&rsquo;s &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; is found. The full
story is pretty awesome, and you should definitely
<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&amp;share=1">give it a read</a>
if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>This idea of &ldquo;randomly trying things until something good-enough is found&rdquo;
appealed to my hacker sensibilities, so I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>To work around this incorrect mapping issue, I begin by jittering the
random-seed used by the perfect-hash-function generator, trying to find a set of
hash maps with the least number of incorrect mappings. Once I&rsquo;ve got something
that seems &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; (i.e: whatever minimum I happened to find while
randomly iterating through seeds), I export a static &ldquo;fixup&rdquo; table of
uncompressed <code>(shortcode, emoji)</code> pairs, which gets linearly scanned prior to
iterating through the main set of hash tables.</p>
<p>Tada, problem solved! And to think, all we needed to do was
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=50&amp;v=N1uiLR6luWo">spin the wheel</a> a couple
times!</p>
<p>This seems to work surprisingly well, with the current dataset only requiring a
miniscule ~250 bytes of fixup-table overhead to achieve perfect accuracy for
valid inputs (when using a 8-bit key hash).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> It turns out that this trick is only useful when using small key hashes
that are prone to higher collision rates (such as a simple 8-bit hash). For this
particular project, I decided that the slightly larger overhead of using 16-bit
hashes outweighed the extra false-positive rates introduced by using an 8-bit
hash.</p>

<p>This project has been a real hodgepodge of hacks on top of hacks, but
nevertheless, the end result is a lookup function that crunches ~34kb of raw,
un-queryable data into a miniscule ~20kb of code + data that can be queried in
constant time without requiring any dynamic allocation at runtime. Neato!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty much done with this project for now, but there are still a few ideas
that might be worth exploring to compress things down even more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compressing the emoji UTF-8 strings using some sort of domain specific
representation
<ul>
<li>e.g: it seems like most emoji fall under a
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30470079/emoji-value-range">small subrange</a>
of unicode codepoints, it might be possible to shave a couple bits of
overhead from each emoji mapping by adding/removing an offset from the
stored value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using non-standard key hash sizes (i.e: 9-bit, 10-bit, etc&hellip;).
<ul>
<li>Follow up: automatically trying out various key hash sizes to minimize
space overhead while maintaining a favorable hash-collision rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually cleaning up this abomination of a codebase and releasing a proper
library that employs these various techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and of course, I should probably port it to
<a href="https://github.com/daniel5151/qmk_firmware">one of my keyboards</a>. After all,
that was the whole inspiration for this endeavor!</p>
<p>Terrible source code is
<a href="https://github.com/daniel5151/compressed-emoji-shortcodes">available on GitHub</a>.
The disclaimer at the top of the README file should tell you all you need to
know about the quality of the codebase 😬</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements<a href="#acknowledgements" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This project wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the incredible
<a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf">rust-phf</a> library. The in-tree version of
<code>rust-phf</code> is a stripped down version and heavily modified version the library,
optimizing the map&rsquo;s internal representation for this particular use-case.</p>
<p>The initial POC of this project was based off of
<a href="https://github.com/kornelski/gh-emoji">https://github.com/kornelski/gh-emoji</a>.</p>
<p>The emoji shortcode database is downloaded directly from GitHub&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/github/gemoji/tree/master">gemoji</a> library.</p>
