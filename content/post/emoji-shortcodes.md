Have you ever wondered what's the smallest amount of static storage (code +
data) needed to map emoji :shortcodes: to emoji?

Probably not... but now that I've posed the question, aren't you at least a
little curious what the answer might be?

So hey, if you've got some time to spare, why not stick around a while and learn
a bit about cool topics such as perfect hashing, probabalistic data structures,
and 2D dynamic programming algorithms?

Take a break from solving whatever "important problem" you're working on, kick
back, relax, and join me on my [somewhat useless] quest to find a highly
compressed emoji :shortcode: lookup function!

## What even is a "Highly Compressed Emoji Shortcode Lookup Function"?

Before embarking on our quest, we should probably clarify what it is we're
looking for exactly exactly.

We want to write a function that accepts shortcode strings as input, and outputs
UTF-8 emoji as output:

```rust
// e.g: shortcode_to_emoji("flamingo") -> Some("🦩")
fn shortcode_to_emoji(input: &str) -> Option<&str>
```

At first glance, this doesn't seem to difficult: just find a free, open source
dataset of emoji shortcodes, load that data into memory, construct a hashmap,
and start querying it - easy peasy!

Not so fast.

While that approach would work just fine on your fancy shmancy
Linux/Windows/macOS/TempleOS powered desktop computer, what if we wanted to run
this lookup function on something a little bit more... embedded? If we tried to
dynamically construct a hashmap at runtime on a tiny, resource-constrained
ARM/AVR microcontroller, we'd very quickly run out of dynamic memory (assuming
something like `malloc` is even _available_ on said platform)!

Indeed, therein lies the need for a "Highly Compressed" lookup function - if we
want to run this code on an embedded MCU, the lookup function lookup function
will have to occupy as little static storage (code _and_ read-only data) as
possible.

## 💡 Inspiration 💡

I'm a big fan of
[custom mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards), as
aside from looking and sounding awesome, they're also an excellent
hardware-hacking platform. Most custom mechanical keyboards use the open source
[QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), which comes with a host of
built-in features for doing just about anything you'd want on a keyboard.

One particularly useful QMK feature is its ability to
[type Unicode characters](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode).
In a nutshell, you can program your keyboard such that when a certain key (or
sequence of keys) is pressed, it will send whatever keystrokes are required to
input Unicode on any of the several
[supported platforms](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode#2-input-modes-id-input-modes).
This is great, because it means that the 🅱 emoji is never more than a few
keystrokes away!

One somewhat annoying limitation of QMK's built-in Unicode support is that users
are required to define which emoji they'd like to use _ahead of time_. While
it's not too difficult to find a set of "workhorse" emoji to preload onto the
keyboard, it'd certainly be convenient to also be able to type more "bespoke"
emoji when the need arises. Sure, quick and easy access to the 🅱 emoji is great
and all, but what about those rare cases where I quickly need access to the 🦩
emoji? What am I supposed to do - use my OS's built-in emoji picker like a
_peasant??_ Never!

And so, I decided to spend my valuable free time on something some folks might
call "a total waste of time": writing a Rust library that exports a single
function that can look up emoji shortcodes using the minimum amount of code +
read-only data, and without requiring _any_ heap allocation!

Now, without further ado, let's dive into the implementation!

## 📝 Getting a feel for the Data 📝

First things first, we'll need a dataset of emoji shortcodes to work with. For
this project, I decided to use the same emoji database as used by GitHub, since
it's the one I'm most familiar with, and it's also readily available as a big
'ol
[JSON blob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gemoji/master/db/emoji.json).
The particular dataset exhibits the following properties:

|                                |                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| total shortcode, emoji pairs   | 1848           |
| raw shortcode character data   | 18715 bytes    |
| raw emoji UTF-8 character data | 11096 bytes    |
| average shortcode length       | 10.12716 bytes |
| average emoji length           | 6.004329 bytes |

Converting this data set into a CSV file of raw `shortcode,emoji` pairs would
result in roughly **\~34kb** file. Aside from being a totally impractical data
structure for querying on a embedded MCU, 34kb is quite a bit of data in an
embedded context! Let's see if we can do any better...

## 🛠️ Implementation 🛠️

Since we know all the key-value pairs ahead of time, a good place to start off
might be to generate a
[perfect hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function) of
shortcodes to emoji at compile time. Unlike typical hash functions, _perfect_
hash functions guarantee that each individual valid input is mapped to a
_distinct_ index. This property means that there is _zero wasted space_ in the
underlying hash table.

In fact, the foundation of this entire project is the incredible
[`rust-phf`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf), which I ended up heavy
modifying and optimizing for this specific use-case. That said, even without
doing any modifications, the base `rust-phf` crate results in **\~100kb** of
code + data overhead, and can be used on systems without dynamic allocation.

Now, 100kb doesn't _seem_ that bad, but when you consider that the raw dataset
of shortcodes + emoji is only \~34kb, and the fact that most embedded platforms
I'm targeting have at most \~256kb of flash ROM, it's should be obvious that
there's plenty of room for improvement.

Not to spoil the ending, but by using the host of optimizations and data
layout/representation tricks outlined in the next couple sections, that 100kb of
number ends up shrinking down to a measly **\~20kb!**

### Trick 1 - Storing hashes of 🔑 keys 🔑 instead of the keys themselves

Let's start off with a guiding question:

> Why do hash tables need to store both values _and_ keys, even in situations
> where there's never a need to iterate over key-value pairs in the map?

This question has a couple different answers, but the one most relevant to this
discussion is that hash tables need a copy of the original key to prevent _false
positive lookups_, whereby an invalid key returns an unrelated value.

A fundamental property of hash tables is that given a unlimited set of inputs
(i.e: all possible strings), and a limited set of outputs (i.e: the \~2000 emoji
in our data set), a hash collision is essentially guaranteed to happen. As such,
hash tables need to employ some sort of
[collision resolution algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution).

> If hash tables didn't have any collision resolution, just imagine what sort of
> chaos simple input errors might result in! A harmless spelling mistake while
> trying to input `:smile:`, compounded with some spectacularly bad statistical
> chance, somehow results in `:eggplant:` instead!
>
> I can see it now: one second you're having a friendly chat with a co-worker,
> when all of a sudden \*WHABAM\* you're in a meeting with HR frantically trying
> to explain how hashing works, and that this is all just one big
> misunderstanding! Yikes :scream:

In our case, since we happen to be using a _perfect_ hash function, the conflict
resolution strategy happens to be incredibly simple: just include an
[additional check](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/blob/9b70bd9/phf/src/map.rs#L88)
that compares the input key against the expected key at that particular index.
With this one simple trick, the hash table can ensure that invalid inputs are
rejected with 100% certainty!

**But enough about how hash functions work in general, we have a problem we want
to solve!**

One key insight about our problem is that we are only even interested in
_looking up_ values, and don't actually care about what the set of valid keys
is.

This begs the question: **Is there any way we could somehow _avoid_ storing all
the keys in their entirety?**

At last, we arrive at our first trick: Instead of storing each shortcode key in
it's entirety as a raw string (which would take up a _lot_ of space, around
`size_of(char*) + 10` bytes on average), just store a **small _secondary hash_
of the key!**

This trick results in some absolutely _monstrous_ space savings, cutting the
\~18kb of raw shortcode string data down to just **\~4kb** (i.e:
`size_of(hash("input")) * num_shortcodes` bytes, assuming a 16-bit hash).

---

Unfortunately, this trick doesn't come for free, and brings with it a nasty
side-effect: since the hash function only stores a _hash_ of the key, **the
collision resolution algorithm stops being 100% accurate.** Indeed, the lookup
function ends up having an _infinite_ number of "false positive" inputs :scream:

Fortunately, it turns out that it's possible to greatly reduce the number of
"reasonable" false positives ("reasonable" in the sense that the input isn't
comprised on random gibberish characters) simply by increasing the number of
bits used for the secondary hash.

Now, I'm no statistician, so I really can't comment to the theoretical impact of
using more/less bits to reduce false positives, but I can say that though some
extensive empirical testing - both via
[automated testing](https://github.com/daniel5151/compressed-emoji-shortcodes/tree/main/kowalski-analysis)
and human trials (read: mashing random keys on my keyboard) - it seems that a
**16-bit hash works almost perfectly**. Heck, if you're really worried about
space, **even a single byte hash works great!**

And don't just take my word for it - go and play around with the
[online demo](https://prilik.com/compressed-emoji-shortcodes) and see how well
this "imperfect" collision resolution algorithm actually works - it aught to be
pretty difficult to find any "reasonable" false positive inputs.

### Trick 2 - Storing emoji without the overhead of offsets or 👉 pointers 👈

The typical way to store static strings within a map is to store _pointers_ to
the strings, and storing the strings themselves somewhere else in read-only
memory. Unfortunately, in this particular situation, this naive way of storing
strings results in some substantial overhead, as aside from storing the raw
UTF-8 string data for each emoji, we also need to store a pointer to the
string + some way to mark the bounds of a string (either by storing the string's
length, or by including a null terminator). Given that most emoji are only \~6
bytes long, a `size_of(char*) + 1` overhead per entry is _brutal_.

In memory, this naive table layout would look something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="A single table storing strings of any length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/naive_table.png"/>
  <br>
  <i>Total overhead:<br><code>size_of(Table) + (Table.Emoji.len * (1 + size_of(char*))) + (raw emoji UTF8)</code></i>
  <br>
  <i>(Assuming string length is stored alongside the pointer)</i>
</p>

Can we do any better? Absolutely!

Instead of generating a single map containing all the shortcode-emoji mappings,
`n` distinct maps are generated instead, one for each unique emoji string size.
With this setup, string data can be accessed directly, without requiring any
additional pointer indirection.

In memory, this smarter table layout would look something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Multiple tables storing strings of uniform length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/smarter_table.png"/>
  <br>
  <i>Total overhead:<br><code>2 * size_of(Table) + (raw emoji UTF8)</code></i>
</p>

Look at that! We totally cut out the `Table.Emoji.len * (1 + size_of(char*))`
overhead!

Of course, this optimization did require allocating a whole new table, which
does incur an additional `size_of(Table)` bytes of overhead, but if the table
contains a large number of values, then this extra overhead is negligible with
respect to the space saved by removing the pointer indirection.

_Note:_ Now that there are multiple tables, the lookup function needs to be
modified to iterate through _all_ the tables, returning when a result is found.
This is an easy fix to implement, though it can result in some problems down the
line...

### Trick 2.a - ✂️ Trimming Tiny Tables ✂️

_Content Warning: \*Spicy\* 2D Dynamic Programming Algorithms Ahead_

Before covering the last major trick, I should mention an interesting
optimization opportunity related to generating multiple tables:

For our particular emoji shortcode dataset, the following tables gets generated:

<div id="emoji-table">
<style>
#emoji-table {
    width: 300px;
    margin: auto;
}
#emoji-table td {
    padding: 5px 10px;
}
</style>

| emoji len | entries |
| --------- | ------- |
| 3         | 64      |
| 4         | 1081    |
| 5         | 2       |
| 6         | 109     |
| 7         | 109     |
| 8         | 260     |
| 10        | 1       |
| 11        | 69      |
| 13        | 109     |
| 14        | 1       |
| 15        | 4       |
| 16        | 7       |
| 17        | 1       |
| 18        | 13      |
| 20        | 3       |
| 25        | 9       |
| 27        | 3       |
| 28        | 3       |

</div>

As it turns out, there are plenty of awkwardly-sized emoji in this data set.
While most emoji tend to be in the 3-8 byte range, some emoji take up
substantially more space. For example, the flag of Wales emoji (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿) takes up a
whopping 28 bytes!

This is quite unfortunate, as it requires generating whole new tables just for
these occasional odd-sized emoji. This is undesirable for several reasons:

1.  Each table has an overhead associated with it, namely, the `size_of(Table)`
    itself + the various bits of data it maintains internal pointers. For
    certain smaller tables, this overhead can be greater than the size of the
    data stored within the table itself!
2.  The more tables there are, the more likely a hash-collision occurs while
    looking up entries deeper into the list. This will be covered in more detail
    in the Trick 3 section later on.

Suffice it to say, it'd be nice if we could somehow consolidate tables with
fewer entries into their nearest-neighbors, thereby saving ourselves from
requiring all these additional tables. As it turns out, it's not actually that
difficult to consolidate two tables into one - all it takes is a bit of
null-padding!

Say we have a table that stores strings of length 3, containing
`["foo", "bar", "baz"]`, and another table that stores strings of length 4,
containing just `["four"]`. We can merge these two tables together by adding
some null-padding to each element in the first table, and then merging the two
tables together. The final result is a _single_ table that stores strings of
length 4, containing `["foo\0", "bar\0", "baz\0", "four"]`.

As it turns out, finding the _optimal_ order in which to merge tables is
actually surprisingly tricky, and presents the opportunity for some interesting
algorithm crafting. In fact, we can re-write this problem more abstractly as
follows:

> Consider a set of tables `T1..Tn`, where each table stores `m` strings of
> length `n`.
>
> Each table has a fixed overhead of `K` bytes associated with it.
>
> Given two tables `Ta` and `Tb` with `ma` and `mb` entries respectively, is it
> possible to _consolidate_ the two tables into a single table by padding the
> strings contained within the `T_min(a, b)` table with `max(a, b) - min(a, b)`
> "padding" bytes, and then merging the two tables into a single `T_max(a, b)`
> table with `ma + mb` entries.
>
> Q1. Find an algorithm that consolidates the tables that minimizes the total
> space used.
>
> Q2. Find an algorithm that consolidates the maximum number of tables without
> introducing any additional space overhead.

The two questions optimize for the two different shortcomings listed above:
space saving, and hash-collisions. Which of the two algorithms to use depends on
the data set and what sort of properties you want the lookup function to have.

Now, truth be told, the algorithm that's currently implemented in the library on
GitHub is _absolutely horrendous_. I wrote it _very_ late at night, and I've
been too lazy to delete it + rewrite it ever since.

Thankfully, I happen to be friends with someone who's pretty darn good at these
sorts of algorithm questions, and managed to [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356/)
my friend [Ethan Hardy](https://github.com/ethan-hardy) into finding a really
elegant and interesting solution to the problem.

Since I'm more of a "maker"-type software engineer rather than a "computer
scientist"-type software engineer, I asked Ethan to describe the algorithm in
his own words:

> To full optimize our space usage with these tables, we can employ the use of

I _really_ recommend checking out Ethan's writeup - it's really cool seeing how
dynamic programming can be used to solve a "real world" problem, as opposed to
just contrived leetcode-style questions.

### Trick 3 - Eliminate invalid mappings using 🎲 randomness 🎲 and fixup tables

Unfortunately, there is a critical issue associated with using Trick #2 - using
multiple maps may result in incorrect mappings for _valid_ inputs. In the
single-map approach, the properties of the PHF ensure that each valid input is
mapped to a unique index, while in the multi-map approach, this property no
longer holds, as valid inputs are also checked against hashmaps they _aren't_
in, opening the door for hash-collisions.

This is totally unacceptable, and has to be accounted for!

The approach I took was inspired by a bit of tech folklore from Naughty Dog
studios: while working on the original Crash Bandicoot, the developers were
having trouble fitting game assets into the PS1's very limited memory. The
solution they came up with? Writing a custom packer tool that randomly tests
various packing arrangements until one that's "good enough" is found. The full
story is pretty awesome, and you should definitely
[give it a read](https://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&share=1)
if you haven't already.

This idea of "randomly trying things until something good-enough is found"
appealed to my hacker sensibilities, so I decided to give it a shot.

To work around this incorrect mapping issue, I begin by jittering the
random-seed used by the perfect-hash-function generator, trying to find a set of
hash maps with the least number of incorrect mappings. Once I've got something
that seems "good enough" (i.e: whatever minimum I happened to find while
randomly iterating through seeds), I export a static "fixup" table of
uncompressed `(shortcode, emoji)` pairs, which gets linearly scanned prior to
iterating through the main set of hash tables.

Tada, problem solved! And to think, all we needed to do was
[spin the wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=50&v=N1uiLR6luWo) a couple
times!

This seems to work surprisingly well, with the current dataset only requiring a
miniscule \~250 bytes of fixup-table overhead to achieve perfect accuracy for
valid inputs (when using a 8-bit key hash).

_Note:_ It turns out that this trick is only useful when using small key hashes
that are prone to higher collision rates (such as a simple 8-bit hash). For this
particular project, I decided that the slightly larger overhead of using 16-bit
hashes outweighed the extra false-positive rates introduced by using an 8-bit
hash.

---

## Conclusion

This project has been a real hodgepodge of hacks on top of hacks, but
nevertheless, the end result is a lookup function that crunches \~34kb of raw,
un-queryable data into a miniscule \~20kb of code + data that can be queried in
constant time without requiring any dynamic allocation at runtime. Neato!

I'm pretty much done with this project for now, but there are still a few ideas
that might be worth exploring to compress things down even more:

-   Compressing the emoji UTF-8 strings using some sort of domain specific
    representation
    -   e.g: it seems like most emoji fall under a
        [small subrange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30470079/emoji-value-range)
        of unicode codepoints, it might be possible to shave a couple bits of
        overhead from each emoji mapping by adding/removing an offset from the
        stored value.
-   Using non-standard key hash sizes (i.e: 9-bit, 10-bit, etc...).
    -   Follow up: automatically trying out various key hash sizes to minimize
        space overhead while maintaining a favorable hash-collision rate.
-   Actually cleaning up this abomination of a codebase and releasing a proper
    library that employs these various techniques

Oh, and of course, I should probably port it to
[one of my keyboards](https://github.com/daniel5151/qmk_firmware). After all,
that was the whole inspiration for this endeavor!
