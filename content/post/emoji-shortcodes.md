Have you ever wondered what's the smallest amount of static storage (code +
data) needed to map emoji shortcodes to emoji?

Probably not, but now that you've heard the question, want to find out?

If so, then read onwards, and join my on my somewhat useless quest to find a
highly compressed representation of the entire
[shortcode emoji](https://emojipedia.org/shortcodes/) mapping that can be
indexed _without_ requiring any dynamic allocation!

<!--more-->

In other words: how we might write a function that accepts shortcode strings as
input, and outputs UTF-8 emoji as output?

```rust
// e.g: shortcode_to_emoji("flamingo") -> Some("ü¶©")
fn shortcode_to_emoji(input: &str) -> Option<&str>
```

## Inspiration

I'm a big fan of
[custom mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards), as
aside from looking and sounding awesome, they're also an excellent
hardware-hacking platform. Most custom mechanical keyboards use the open source
[QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), which comes with a host of
built-in features for doing just about anything you'd want on a keyboard.

One particularly useful QMK feature is its ability to
[type Unicode characters](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode).
In a nutshell, you can program your keyboard such that when a certain key (or
sequence of keys) is pressed, it will send whatever keystrokes are required to
input Unicode on any of the several
[supported platforms](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_unicode#2-input-modes-id-input-modes).
This is great, because it means that the üÖ± emoji is never more than a few
keystrokes away!

One somewhat annoying limitation of QMK's built-in Unicode support is that users
are required to define which emoji they'd like to use _ahead of time_. While
it's not too difficult to find a set of "workhorse" emoji to preload onto the
keyboard, it'd certainly be convenient to also be able to type more "bespoke"
emoji when the need arises. Sure, quick and easy access to the üÖ± emoji is great
and all, but what about those rare cases where I quickly need access to the ü¶©
emoji? What am I supposed to do - use my OS's built-in emoji picker like a
_peasant??_ Never!

And so, I decided to spend my valuable free time on something some folks might
call "a total waste of time": writing a Rust library that exports a single
function that can look up emoji shortcodes using the minimum amount of code +
read-only data, and without requiring _any_ heap allocation!

```rust
fn shortcode_to_emoji(input: &str) -> Option<&str>
```

Let's dive into the implementation!

## Getting a feel for the Data

First things first, we'll need a dataset of emoji shortcodes to work with. For
this project, I decided to use the same emoji shortcode database as used by
GitHub, since it's the one I'm most familiar with, and it's also readily
available as a big 'ol
[JSON blob](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gemoji/master/db/emoji.json).
The particular dataset exhibits the following properties:

|                                |                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| total shortcode, emoji pairs   | 1848           |
| raw emoji UTF-8 character data | 11096 bytes    |
| raw shortcode character data   | 18715 bytes    |
| average shortcode length       | 10.12716 bytes |
| average emoji length           | 6.004329 bytes |

Converting this data set into a CSV file of raw `shortcode,emoji` pairs would
result in roughly \~34kb file. Aside from being a totally impractical data
structure for querying on a embedded MCU, 34kb is quite a bit of data in an
embedded context! Let's see if we can do any better...

## Implementation

My library uses a heavily modified version of the incredible
[rust-phf](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf) crate to generate a set of
[perfect hash maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function) mapping
shortcodes to emoji at compile time.

For reference, the unmodified `rust-phf` crate results in nearly _\~100kb_ of
`.rodata`, which blows waaaaay past the flash ROM budget of most keyboard MCUs.

By employing a whole host of optimizations and data layout/representation
tricks, I was able to crunch that 100kb down to a measly **\~20kb of `.text` +
`.rodata`**!

### Trick 1 - Storing hashes of keys (instead of keys themselves)

Instead of naively storing the keys as raw strings (which would take up a _lot_
of space, around `size_of(char*) + 10` bytes on average), the hash map only
stores the _hashes_ of keys.

While this trick can result in some absolutely _monstrous_ space savings, it
does so at the expense of a property most folks take for granted when using a
hash-map: 100% accuracy in rejecting invalid inputs. Indeed, using this
approach, the lookup function will actually have an infinite number of "false
positive" inputs that return nonsense outputs.

Now, I'm no statistician, so I really can't comment to the theoretical accuracy
of this approach, but empirical testing using some automated stress-testing +
human trials (i.e: slamming the keys on my keyboard) seems to suggest that a **2
byte hash works almost perfectly**. Heck, if you're really worried about space,
**even single byte hashes works great!**

And don't just take my word for it - check out the
[online demo](https://prilik.com/compressed-emoji-shortcodes) and play around
with the lookup function directly. It's should be pretty difficult to find any
"reasonable" false positive inputs (i.e: one that's only a misspelling or two
away from a valid input).

---

**_Digression:_ Why does a _perfect_ hash function even need to store the keys
in the first place?**

Like, won't every input just automagically map to the correct value?

Well, while that may be true for _valid_ inputs, plugging an _invalid_ input
into a PHF will simply return some arbitrary index. To reject invalid inputs,
most perfect hash maps will include an
[additional check](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/blob/9b70bd9/phf/src/map.rs#L88)
that compares the input key against the expected key at that particular index.
This ensure that invalid inputs are rejected with 100% certainty.

If this extra check wasn't in place, just imagine what sort of chaos simple
input errors might result in! A harmless spelling mistake while typing
`:smile:`, compounded with some spectacularly bad statistical chance, could
somehow result in typing `:eggplant:` instead. One second you're having a
friendly chat with a co-worker, when BAM you're suddenly in a meeting with HR
where you're frantically trying to explain how perfect hash functions work.
Yikes :eggplant:

### Trick 2 - Storing + retrieving emoji without the overhead offsets / pointers

The typical way to store static strings within a map is to store _pointers_ to
the strings, and storing the strings themselves somewhere else in read-only
memory. Unfortunately, in this particular situation, this naive way of storing
strings results in some substantial overhead, as aside from storing the raw
UTF-8 string data for each emoji, we also need to store a pointer to the
string + some way to mark the bounds of a string (either by storing the string's
length, or by including a null terminator). Given that most emoji are only \~6
bytes long, a `size_of(char*) + 1` overhead per entry is _brutal_.

In memory, this naive table layout would look something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="A single table storing strings of any length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/naive_table.png"/>
</p>

Can we do any better? Absolutely!

Instead of generating a single map containing all the shortcode-emoji mappings,
`n` distinct maps are generated instead, one for each unique emoji string size.
With this setup, string data can be accessed directly, without requiring any
additional pointer indirection.

In memory, this smarter table layout would look something like this:

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Multiple tables storing strings of uniform length" align="center" src="/blog/assets/emoji-shortcodes/smarter_table.png"/>
</p>

Wow, look at all those space saving!

_Note:_ Now that there are multiple tables, the lookup function needs to be
modified to iterate through _all_ the tables, returning when a result is found.
This is an easy fix to implement, though it can result in some problems down the
line...

### Trick 2.a - Trimming Tiny Tables

Before covering the last major trick, I should mention an interesting
optimization opportunity related to generating multiple tables:

For our particular emoji shortcode dataset, the following tables gets generated:

| emoji len | entries |
| --------- | ------- |
| 3         | 64      |
| 4         | 1081    |
| 5         | 2       |
| 6         | 109     |
| 7         | 109     |
| 8         | 260     |
| 10        | 1       |
| 11        | 69      |
| 13        | 109     |
| 14        | 1       |
| 15        | 4       |
| 16        | 7       |
| 17        | 1       |
| 18        | 13      |
| 20        | 3       |
| 25        | 9       |
| 27        | 3       |
| 28        | 3       |

As it turns out, there are plenty of awkwardly-sized emoji in this data set.
While most emoji tend to be in the 3-8 byte range, some emoji take up
substantially more space. For example, the flag of Wales emoji (üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø) takes up a
whopping 28 bytes!

This is quite unfortunate, as it requires generating whole new tables just for
these occasional odd-sized emoji. This is undesirable for several reasons:

1.  Each table has an overhead associated with it, namely, the `size_of` the
    `phf::Map` structure + the various bits of data it maintains internal
    pointers. For certain smaller tables, this overhead can be greater than the
    size of the data stored within the table itself!
2.  The more tables there are, the more likely a hash-collision occurs while
    looking up entries deeper into the list. This will be covered in more detail
    in the Trick 3 section later on.

Suffice it to say, it'd be nice if we could somehow consolidate tables with
fewer entries into their nearest-neighbors, thereby saving ourselves from
requiring all these additional tables. As it turns out, it's not actually that
difficult to consolidate two tables into one - all it takes is a bit of
null-padding!

Say we have a table that stores strings of length 3, containing
`["foo", "bar", "baz"]`, and another table that stores strings of length 4,
containing just `["four"]`. We can merge these two tables together by adding
some null-padding to each element in the first table, and then merging the two
tables together. The final result is a _single_ table that stores strings of
length 4, containing `["foo\0", "bar\0", "baz\0", "four"]`.

As it turns out, finding the _optimal_ order in which to merge tables is
actually surprisingly tricky, and presents the opportunity for some interesting
algorithm crafting. In fact, we can re-write this problem more abstractly as
follows:

> Consider a set of tables `T1..Tn`, where each table stores `m` strings of
> length `n`.
>
> Each table has a fixed overhead of `K` bytes associated with it.
>
> Given two tables `Ta` and `Tb` with `ma` and `mb` entries respectively, is it
> possible to _consolidate_ the two tables into a single table by padding the
> strings contained within the `T_min(a, b)` table with `max(a, b) - min(a, b)`
> "padding" bytes, and then merging the two tables into a single `T_max(a, b)`
> table with `ma + mb` entries.
>
> Q1. Find an algorithm that consolidates the tables that minimizes the total
> space used.
>
> Q2. Find an algorithm that consolidates the maximum number of tables without
> introducing any additional space overhead.

The two questions optimize for the two different shortcomings listed above:
space saving, and hash-collisions. Which of the two algorithms to use depends on
the data set and what sort of properties you want the lookup function to have.

Now, I won't go into the details of how my particular implementation
consolidates tables (if I'm being honest, I wrote that particular algorithm
_very_ late at night, and it is absolutely _horrendous_). That said, I did ask
some of my <a name="smart-friends"></a> smart friends for their thoughts on the
problem, and I've gotten some really clever responses back. It seems like the
optimal solution uses dynamic programming to find the optimal merge order. ‚ú®
Fancy ‚ú®!

If there's enough interest, I'd love to do a follow-up post where I dive into
this particular sub-problem in a bit more detail, and discuss the various
algorithms that one might use to solve this problem. Let me know in the comments
if that's something you'd like to see!

### Trick 3 - Eliminating invalid mappings using random chance and fixup tables

Unfortunately, there is a critical issue associated with using Trick #2 - using
multiple maps may result in incorrect mappings for _valid_ inputs. In the
single-map approach, the properties of the PHF ensure that each valid input is
mapped to a unique index, while in the multi-map approach, this property no
longer holds, as valid inputs are also checked against hashmaps they _aren't_
in, opening the door for hash-collisions.

This is totally unacceptable, and has to be accounted for!

The approach I took was inspired by a bit of tech folklore from Naughty Dog
studios: while working on the original Crash Bandicoot, the developers were
having trouble fitting game assets into the PS1's very limited memory. The
solution they came up with? Writing a custom packer tool that randomly tests
various packing arrangements until one that's "good enough" is found. The full
story is pretty awesome, and you should definitely
[give it a read](https://www.quora.com/How-did-game-developers-pack-entire-games-into-so-little-memory-twenty-five-years-ago/answer/Dave-Baggett?srid=z9ZA&share=1)
if you haven't already.

This idea of "randomly trying things until something good-enough is found"
appealed to my hacker sensibilities, so I decided to give it a shot.

To work around this incorrect mapping issue, I begin by jittering the
random-seed used by the perfect-hash-function generator, trying to find a set of
hash maps with the least number of incorrect mappings. Once I've got something
that seems "good enough" (i.e: whatever minimum I happened to find while
randomly iterating through seeds), I export a static "fixup" table of
uncompressed `(shortcode, emoji)` pairs, which gets linearly scanned prior to
iterating through the main set of hash tables.

Tada, problem solved!

This seems to work surprisingly well, with the current dataset only requiring a
miniscule \~250 bytes of fixup-table overhead to achieve perfect accuracy for
valid inputs (when using a 8-bit key hash).

_Note:_ It turns out that this trick is only useful when using small key hashes
that are prone to higher collision rates (such as a simple 8-bit hash). For this
particular project, I decided that the slightly larger overhead of using 16-bit
hashes outweighed the extra false-positive rates introduced by using an 8-bit
hash.

## Future Work?

This project is a real hodgepodge of hacks on top of hacks, but nevertheless,
the end result is a lookup function that crunches \~34kb of raw, un-queryable
data into a miniscule \~20kb of code + data that can be queried in constant time
without requiring any dynamic allocation at runtime. Neato!

I'm pretty much done with this project for now, but there are still a few ideas
that might be worth exploring to compress things down even more:

-   Compressing the emoji UTF-8 strings using some sort of domain specific
    representation
    -   e.g: it seems like most emoji fall under a
        [small subrange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30470079/emoji-value-range)
        of unicode codepoints, it might be possible to shave a couple bits of
        overhead from each emoji mapping by adding/removing an offset from the
        stored value.
-   Using non-standard key hash sizes (i.e: 9-bit, 10-bit, etc...).
    -   Follow up: automatically trying out various key hash sizes to minimize
        space overhead while maintaining a favorable hash-collision rate.
-   Actually cleaning up this abomination of a codebase and releasing a proper
    library that employs these various techniques

Oh, and of course, I should probably port it to
[one of my keyboards](https://github.com/daniel5151/qmk_firmware). After all,
that was the whole inspiration for this endeavor!
